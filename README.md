Hi! Welcome to the repository for my solution to this <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/chat-app-css-illustration-O5auMkFqY" target="_blank">Frontend Mentor challenge</a>!

# Summary
This one was really fun and challenging! I hadn't really made shapes like the chevrons before so it took me a bit of thinking to figure out how to make them. It is currently the highest level challenge for HTML and CSS on Frontend Mentor, so I think I am finally ready to get into JavaScript!

For this challenge, I used the following: 
- CSS Grid
- Sass/SCSS
- BEM

# Looking Back
- This challenge's design uses very small font sizes - I personally would have gone for quite a bit bigger, but the goal is to get the design as close as possible to the original design so I used the same sizes.
- I struggled a little on the background shapes initially, but once I figured out the math to position them depending on screen size on smaller widths, I was good to go with the rest of the project!
- I'm pretty sure I'm misunderstanding how BEM works - My class names got pretty long and I feel like I should've had multiple blocks within the grid block instead of the way I did it.

# The End
Thanks for checking out my solution to this challenge! If you have any feedback, I would love if you reached out to me or left a comment on my <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/chat-app-css-illustration-sassscss-bem-css-grid-VEWQxD4YNV" target="_blank">solution page</a> - I'm always looking to improve!

Happy coding!
